The content of video is about an activation game. For rising action,the video used a dramatic structure to build up the tension and extend the “cut to black” transition, it will allows tension to build up. For the climax, the video used the fightinscenes edited with a lot of jump cut in a fast pace, this allows the video to reach its maximum tension. For the falling action, The video also extend the “cut to black” transition. Therefore, it will slowly fade up and enters in to the video “quotation scene”( end scene). The Dramatic Structure allows the video to have a more rhythmic flow. Hence, it will have a more roundup feeling. The video used cross dissolve as the main transition method since, it does not only allow the video to have a bette flow, also gives the audience a better experience.  

Ending (Requirement 4) 
Using Adobe Photoshop to create the “quote” ending. In "quote" ending image, we used the explosion brush effect to create the dust and the “burned” letters, used the benefit of the layer features to add in the crack texture, and used the gradient map to change the gradient of the photo.

We used the built in export feature in the Adobe Premier Pro. 
The width*height of the video is one of the main cause of a large file size. The video file size must to be less then 20 MB. Hence, we chose the width*height to be 854*480. The resolution is instead of using a high resolution video. Therefore, we exported a 480p SD video. This video is not high resolution, but the resolution is still acceptable.
