For this assignment, as it is a video about a activation game, we used a dramatic structure to build up the tension.  
For the rising action, we extend the “cut to black” transition,  so that it will allows tension to build up gradually. As the music fades in and the volume of the bass line slowly builds up. 
For the climax, we have the fighting scenes edited with a lot of jump cut in a fast pace, this allows the video to reach its maximum tension. 
For the falling action, we also extend the “cut to black” transition,  so that it will slowly fade up and enters in to the video “quotation scene”( end scene). 
This Dramatic Structure allows the video to have a more rhythmic flow so that it will have a more roundup feeling. We used cross dissolve as the main transition method since, it does not only allow the video to have a bette flow, it also gives the audience a better experience.  

Ending (Requirement 4) 
Using Adobe Photoshop to create the “quote” ending. In this image, we used the explosion brush effect to create the dust and the “burned” letters. We also use the benefit of the layer features to add in the crack texture. Lastly we use the gradient map to change the gradient of the photo.

We used the built in export feature in the Adobe Premier Pro. 
The width*height of the video is one of the main cause of a large file size. To have this video file size to be less then 20 MB we chose the width*height to be 854*480. The resolution is another great course for large file size. instead of using a high resolution video, we exported a 480p SD video. This video is not high resolution but the resolution is still acceptable.
